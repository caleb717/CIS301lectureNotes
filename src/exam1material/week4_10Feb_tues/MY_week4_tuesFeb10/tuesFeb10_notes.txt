    #5: p ∨ q ∨ r ⊢ r ∨ q ∨ p

    What will the structure be?
    p ∨ q ∨ r: Top-level is the rightmost OR 
    (p ∨ q) ∨ r

    Try OrE on premise
    SubProof: assume (p || q)

            goal: (r ∨ q) ∨ p
            top-level is rightmost OR   
            Could introduce Or if have (r || q) orr if I had (p)

            //nested OrE
            SubProof: assume p
                OrI2((r ∨ q) ∨ p)

            goal: (r ∨ q) ∨ p
   
            Subproof: assume q
                OrI(r || q)
                OrI((r ∨ q) ∨ p)

                goal: (r ∨ q) ∨ p

    SubProof: Assume (r)

            goal: (r ∨ q) ∨ p

    How to build conclusion?


Exam 1 is Thursday, February 12
    Exam review session (by Erik and Drake):
        Wednesday, February 11, 2:30-5:00 pm in DUE 1118

No new homework this week

/////////////////////

Today:
- more involved natural deduction examples
- exam 1 review

/////////////////////

Reminder: implies-elimination, ImplyE

          P,P → Q
ImplyE: -----------
            Q



Implies symbol.

Typing a → in Logika for natural deduction:

    __>:

(two underscores, >, :)

//////////////////////////

Bigger examples: ex1.sc, ex2.sc, ex3.sc


/////////////////////////

Logika features/tips

- see proof step summary
- renumber/reformat proofs
- interpreting errors


/////////////////////////

General proof strategy to this point

1. List premises
2. Break down any easier premises to get extra info

3. look at the conclusion

4. Consider if you will need OrE

Note: Always think about ORDER OF OPERATIONS (), !, AND, OR, IMPLIES

(including today).


See Canvas announcement for list of topics.




How to prove two propositional logic statements are 
equivalent?

    Approach 1: Create two truth tables. For Every possible truth assignment, the two 
                statements have the same exact output

    Approach 2:
        deduciton with two proofs




How to prove propositional logic statements are 
NOT equivalent?
Find ONEEE truth assignment that produces different outputs



What is satisfiability? 
    need ONE truth assignment where the statement outputs true
    Tautology(all true) or contingent(some true)
NOT satisfiable
    need FULL truth tabl to show the statement always outputs false
    Contradicory 



- Determining whether an argument is valid or invalid
    (what is an argument?)

    premises, conclusion

    valid: Every time all premises are true, the conclusion is also true

    how prove valid?
    1) truth table with all premises and conclusion
        looking for truth assigments that make all premises true, also make conclusion true

    2) deduction ?? (NEED TO REVIEW)

    how prove invalid?
    Just need one truth assignment where all the premises are true, but the conclusion is false


/////////////////////////////////////////

Closed notes/computers.


Mix of multiple choice (like quizzes) and open-ended (like homework)

Some problems will ask for a proof or explanation --
    read carefully!

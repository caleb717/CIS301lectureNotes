HW 1 - due Tuesday, January 27
    be sure to explain your reasoning when asked
    on logic puzzles, should be clear why your answer is the only  
        one

All ints.

if (x < 3 || y > 4) {
    statements1;
}
else if (x < 5 && y == 7) {
    statements2;
}
else {
    statements3;
}


--> is it possible for "statements2" to execute?

Know, (x < 3 || y > 4) is false
 so (x >= 3 && y <= 4),
 also (x < 5 && y == 7) is true [both sides need to be true]

So not possible because y can't be less than or equal to 4 while ALSO equaling 7.

More with knights and knaves.

knights: each full statement that they make is true
knave: each full statement must be false


You meet three inhabitants: Sarah, Bill and Mae.

Sarah tells you that only a knave would say that Bill is a knave.
Bill claims that it's false that Mae is a knave.
Mae tells you, "Bill would tell you that I am a knave."

What types are Sarah, Bill, and Mae?


(How might we simplify everything?) Less confusing way, rewritten

Sarah says Bill is a Knight
Bill says Mae is a knight
Mae says, Bill would say I'm a knave

Now Testing
Suppose
Sarah is a knight, so Bill = knight, so Mae = knight, [can't be true because of the last statement]

Sarah is a knave, so Bill = knave, so Mae = knave. Makes it TRUE when you compare it to last statement
Bill would lie and say Bill is a knight, but Mae lies, it's like a double negative

All 3 are knaves

Lion always lies on Mondays, Tuesdays, and Wednesdays.
Lion always tells the truth on other days.
Unicorn always lies on Thursdays, Fridays, and Saturdays,
    and always tells the truth on other days.

On Sunday, everyone tells the truth.

Lion says: "Yesterday was one of my lying days."
Unicorn says: "Yesterday was one of my lying days, too."

What day is it?
Thursday, Lion is telling the truth that he lied wednesday, Unicorn is lying (which he is supposed to do) that he
lied yesterday


////////////////////////////////

Tweedledee and Tweedledum are identical.
You know that one of them lies Mon/Tues/Wed,
and that the other lies Thurs/Fri/Sat.
(They tell the truth on non-lying days.)

(So they both tell the truth on Sunday.)

You don't know which is which.

You see both of them together.
The first one says: "I'm Tweedledum." 
The second one says: "I'm Tweedledee."

Which is which? What day is it?
Has to be Sunday, every other day they would say the say the same name, also they are who they say.



//////////////////////////////////

In-class quiz


//////////////////////////////////

You know that either Tweedledum or Tweedledee has
    lost a rattle.
You find it, and want to return it to the correct one.
You don't know what day it is, but are sure that it isn’t
    Sunday.


(we know one is lying, one is telling truth)

The first one says: "Tweedledee owns the rattle."
The second one says: "I'm Tweedledee!"

Who gets the rattle? The first one

Supopsing first is truth, then rattle goes to dee. Second twin must be lying, so second is dum. That means first is dee and 
he gets the rattle

Supposing second is lie (dum), then rattle goes to dum. Second must be truth, se second is dee. Rattles goes to first, dee.

Who is who?
Not enough information

Based on Shakespeare's "Merchant of Venice".

There are three caskets – one gold, one silver,
    and one lead.
Exactly one of the caskets contains a portrait.
Each casket has a message on it, and you know that at most
    one of the messages is true.

Gold casket: "The portrait is in this casket."
Silver casket: "The portrait is not in this casket."
Lead casket: "The portrait is not in the gold casket."

Options: All are false; One is true, two is false

Suppose portrait in:
Gold: Gold - true, silver - true, lead - false (too many trues)
Silver: Gold - false, silver - false, lead - true (One true, what we need)
Lead: Gold - false, silver - true, lead - true (too many trues)

Where is the portrait? 
Silver casket

Cheryl's birthday problem.

Written for Singapore and Asian Schools Math Olympiad in 2015

Albert and Bernard want to know when Cheryl's birthday is.
Cheryl gives them 10 potential dates:

May 15, May 16, May 19
June 17, June 18
July 14, July 16
August 14, August 15, August 17

Cheryl privately tells Albert her birthday month.
    (May, June, July, or August)

Cheryl privately tells Bernard her birthday day (number).
    (14-19)

Albert says: "I don't know when Cheryl's birthday is,
    but I know Bernard doesn't know too."

Bernard says: "At first I didn't know when Cheryl's
    birthday is, but now I do."

Albert says: "Then I also know when Cheryl's birthday is."


When is it?
July 16

(Not even going to try to explain this one)

///////////////////////////////////

Start truth tables and logic gates.

    have boolean variables
    want to express statements like: p AND (q OR r)

Variables can be true or false

Basic operations:

∧   and (&&)
∨   or (inclusive or ||)
¬   not (!)
→   implies (if/then ->)


Basic logic gates (draw on board)
    AND, OR, NOT

gates still used to design circuits


why do we care about equivalent circuits?


what about programming?

///////////////////////////////////////////////////

Fill in basic operations:


AND:

p q  #  p ∧ q
--------------
T T  #  T  
T F  #  F  
F T  #  F   
F F  #  F  


OR:

p q  #  p ∨ q
--------------
T T  #   T 
T F  #   T 
F T  #   T 
F F  #   F 


NOT:

p  # ¬p
--------
T  # F
F  # T

////////////////////////////////////////////////

IMPLIES operator →

"If I have a test, then I will study"

p: I have a test
q: I will study

p → q

It is false if we have BROKEN A PROMISE.
Otherwise we have not.

p q  #  p → q
--------------
T T  #   T 
T F  #   F   
F T  #   T 
F F  #   T  

/////////////////////////////////////////

How does the implies operator relate to programming?

If/then statements

//////////////////////////////////////////

Design circuits for:

¬(p ∨ q)       (p NOR q)


p XOR q (with just the gates we've seen, not a specific XOR gate)



/////////////////////////////////////

How would we evaluate the output of these circuits with
different inputs?



Graphically build circuits:

https://logic.ly/demo/


//////////////////////////////////////

Evaluating logical statements.

Basic operations:

∧ - AND
∨ - OR (inclusive or)
¬ - NOT
→ - IMPLIES

////////////////////////////////////////

Consider ¬p ∨ q ∧ r.

--> what operation do we do first?



Order of operations

In math? PEMDAS (), exponent, multiply/divide, add/subtact



For logic statements:

From highest (happens first) to lowest (happens last) precedence:
(), NOT, AND, OR, IMPLIES
PNAOP

////////////////////////////////////////////////

Given this statement:

    ¬p ∨ q ∧ r

Add () to show the order of operations.

(¬p) ∨ (q ∧ r)


Evaluate the above statement using these
variable assignments:

p is T
q is F
r is F

(¬p) ∨ (q ∧ r)
(F) ∨ (F)
Output: False

///////////////////////////////////////////

Next:
- more with order of operations
- bigger truth tables
- parse trees
- begin propositional logic
